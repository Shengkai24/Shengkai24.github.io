During my research assistant position at the Rexach Lab and Samarasinghe Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, I was responsible for culturing and passaging human embryonic stem cells (hESC). I specialized in inducing the differentiation of these stem cells into various brain organoids, including the cerebral cortex (Cx), ganglionic eminence (GE), and hippocampus (Hip), introducing mutations such as SCN8A and Tau for further study. Additionally, I cultured and fused various organoids to study pathological changes in different models, employing techniques such as local field potential recording, fixation, sectioning and immunostaining. Furthermore, I maintained and updated an organoids tracing record, ensuring systematic documentation. Beyond these responsibilities, I also managed laboratory operations and coordinated resources to optimize workflow and resource utilization.
