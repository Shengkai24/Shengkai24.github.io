Visual search involves detecting perceptual features that constitute target objects while simultaneously ignoring non-target stimuli. The ability to identify relevant information among irrelevant distracting stimuli is critically important for effective decision-making and goal-directed behavior. The present study aimed to identify neurophysiological indices of target identification and distraction during visual search performance. Forty healthy participants completed a visual search task in which they had to determine if a target letter &quot;F&quot; was right-side up (2/3 of all trials, frequent target) or flipped upside down (1/3 of all trials, infrequent target). Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were obtained during the task, and event-related potential (ERP) indices of brain function were derived at multiple stages of information processing. Analyses focused on the P2, N2, and P3 components of the ERP waveform, which have peak amplitudes at approximately 200, 200-300, and 300-500 msec post-stimulus, respectively. Localization of the cortical sources of ERP component activity was also investigated using the standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) approach. The results indicated that there was enhancement of amplitude at frontal scalp electrodes for the P2 and P3 components during trials with high interference distraction, compared to trials with low interference distraction. This finding suggests greater involvement of executive neural systems, at both early and later stages of information processing, when there is a need for filtering highly distracting information. There was enhancement of N2 component amplitude during trials with infrequent targets, or when there was high interference distraction, in comparison to trials with frequent targets and low interference distraction. This indicates that the N2 component is modulated when there is stimulus information that produces more complex visual search (i.e., conflict monitoring function of the N2). The findings provide insight into the neural activity associated with different stages of visual search performance. Engagement of executive control related to the filtering of distracting non-target stimuli is engaged within 200 msec after the onset of a complex visual stimulus array (P2 effect). Mechanisms related to the resolution of conflict that may exist either/both in the target and non-target stimuli are engaged within 200- 300 msec post-stimulus (N2 effect), and a second pass attentional control process that likely enables target stimulus categorization is engaged at approximately 300-500 msec post-stimulus (P3 effect). Cortical source analysis using the sLORETA approach indicated that these mechanisms are likely enabled by a distributed cortical network with activity that is most pronounced in frontal and parietal brain regions.
