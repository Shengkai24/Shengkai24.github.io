**Project 1: Investigation of Distraction and Attention During Complex Visual Search ([Master’s thesis](https://shengkai24.github.io/publication/2023-05-10-Neural_Indices_of_Attention_and_Distraction_During_Visual_Search)):** For my Master’s thesis, I invited forty-four healthy participants to engage in a Visual search task while their brain activity was monitored using a 256-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net. I processed the collected EEG data to create event related potential (ERP) waveforms for Fz, Cz, and Pz, which are clusters located on the midline of the scalp. Utilizing SPSS, I conducted a detailed analysis of latency and amplitude, comparing them across different trail types and clusters. Additionally, I collected and conjointly analyzed participants' performance records and demographic data. To gain deeper insights, I inspected and analyzed the EEG data using EEG source imaging. A key innovation of this project was designing a novel visual search task and employing the EEG system to observe participants' brain activity, thereby identifying specific neurophysiological indices.

**Project 2: GoNoGoFlanker Analysis:** In this study, I examined data from 42 participants, focusing on demographics, Go/NoGoFlanker task performance, and EEG records. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS and GraphPad Prism. To enhance my understanding of the technical aspects and core theories related to the experiment and the GoNoGoFlanker task, I reviewed relevant literature. Additionally, I contributed to writing and editing the paper draft.

**Project 3: ERP Investigation of N-back Task:** For this project, I gathered demographic and medical information from volunteers through questionnaires. I then conducted behavioral experiments involving the N-back task, with EEG system monitoring in place. This allowed me to collect data on participants' N-back task performance and corresponding EEG records.
