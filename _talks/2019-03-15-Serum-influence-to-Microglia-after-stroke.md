I performed subculture and inoculation of BV-2 microglioma cells in a sterile environment using a clean bench and CO2 incubator. I prepared various reagents essential for testing, including BrdU staining, Western Blotting, and qRT-PCR. To extract mouse serum, I employed centrifugation techniques and stored the serum in sterile test tubes. Furthermore, I established oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) models of BV-2 microglia cells, categorizing them into mild and severe treatment groups to mimic mild and severe stroke conditions, respectively.

Maintaining a controlled environment of 37â„ƒ and 5% CO2, I conducted cell culture experiments where experimental groups were treated with serum from the OGD models, while control groups received serum from non-OGD models. BrdU C staining was applied to each group of BV-2 microglioma cells, and cell proliferation was quantified through immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.
