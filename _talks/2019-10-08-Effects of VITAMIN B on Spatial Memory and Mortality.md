I conducted a comprehensive study on the effects of electromagnetic fields on mice. Initially, I measured field strength in various public places, including substations, high-voltage lines, residential buildings, and schools. Through literature review, I derived a realistic and representative field strength prediction value. Following this, I designed and constructed an adjustable electromagnetic field to simulate different environmental conditions.

To investigate the impact of electromagnetic fields on mice, I established six groups of mice, three female and three male, evenly distributed across three teams. Two groups were exposed to a 50Hz 100μT±10μT electromagnetic field, two groups were exposed to the same electromagnetic field while also being fed a suitable amount of vitamin B, and the remaining two groups served as controls with no external electromagnetic field exposure.

During the experiment, I conducted experimental treatments and trained the mice using the Morris water maze, a standard test for assessing spatial learning and memory in rodents. Following the completion of the experimental treatments, I performed a significance test and analyzed the statistical data to draw conclusions about the effects of electromagnetic fields on the cognitive abilities of mice.
