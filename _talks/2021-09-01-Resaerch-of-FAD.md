I conducted behavioral assessments on 5XFAD and Tau transgenic mice using the Barnes maze test, novel object recognition test, and social approach test, utilizing the ANY-maze software for precise data collection. I successfully troubleshooted issues arising during the Barnes maze test to ensure accurate results. The data obtained from these experiments were analyzed and visualized with advanced statistical software, including GraphPad Prism 7 and Origin 2021. My contributions were acknowledged in the publication ['Longitudinal characterization of behavioral, morphological and transcriptomic changes in a tauopathy mouse model. Aging (Albany NY). 2023'](https://shengkai24.github.io/publication/2023-11-03-Longitudinal_characterization_of_behavioral,_morphological_and_transcriptomic_changes_in_a_tauopathy_mouse_model), where my efforts in animal behavior testing were specifically highlighted.

In addition to my work with behavioral testing, I have honed my skills in neuroscientific techniques by performing mouse brain slicing using a vibratome for immunohistochemical analyses. Furthermore, I have expanded my laboratory expertise by acquiring knowledge in Western Blot procedures.
